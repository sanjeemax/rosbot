  By not providing "Findgz-cmake3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz-cmake3" with

    gz-cmake3Config.cmake
    gz-cmake3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz-cmake3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz-cmake3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz-cmake3" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
